        </section>

            <h2>Methods</h2>
            One hundred Magic: The Gathering cards were "single-sleeved" with a
            set of <a href="https://www.dragonshield.com/webshop/us/solid-color-sleeves/70-dragon-shield-matte-black.html" target="_blank">Dragonshield Matte Black sleeves.</a>
            Each sleeve was then given a label from 1 to 100 corresponding and 
            the deck was arranged so that the top card was labelled #1, the 
            second card #2, etc., and finally the bottom card was labeled #100.
            <i>Note: The "bottom card" refers to the card in contact with the table 
                when the deck is placed facedown onto the table.</i>
            Then the deck was shuffled using one of the investigated shuffling methods, namely, "side-shuffling" or riffle shuffling.

            In later studies, the effect of deck size was also investigated: the total number of cards in the deck was decrease from 100 to 80, 60, or 40.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            The goal of this exercise was to assess how many shuffles it takes
            to "sufficiently randomize" a deck of cards. 
            Unfortunately, "sufficiently randomized" is not an easily quantifiable
            metric.
            One way this was assessed here, was by exploiting the <em>Shannon Entropy</em>. 
            The Shannon Entropy can be described as "how little information do I have about a situation."
            Mathematically, the Shannon Entropy, $S$, can be described via,
            \[
            S \propto - \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{outcomes}}}p_i \log p_i
            \]
            where $p_i$ is the probability of outcome $i$.
            In a classic example of a coin flip, one observes that the Shannon Entropy is maximized when a coin is fair, that is the probability of heads is equal to that of tails as follows. 
            In a coin flip, there are two possible outcomes, so $S$ becomes,
            \[
            S = -k p_i \log p_i + -k(1-p_i)\log (1-p_i).
            \]
            where k is a positive constant.
            To find the value of p_i that maximizes $S$, take the derivative with respect to $p_i$ and set it equal to zero,
            \[
            \frac{d S}{d p_i} = -p_i \frac{1}{p_i} - \log p_i (1) - 
                (1-p_i)\frac{-1}{1-p_i} + \log (1-p_i) = 0
            \]
            Simplifying,
            \[
            \log \frac{p_i}{1-pi} = 0   
            \]
            \[
            p_i = 1 - p_i
            \] 
            \[
            p_i = \frac{1}{2}
            \]
            Then we can find a value for $k$ such that the maximal value of $S$ is $1$.
            \[
            S(p_i=0.5) = 1 \implies k\log{2} = 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{\log 2}
            \]
            so for the case of two outcomes, with the indicated maximal value for $S$ and applying the change of base formula,
            \[
            S = -\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{outcomes}}}p_i \log_2 p_i.
            \]
            This phenomena is visualized in Figure 1 wherein contours of constant $S$ in a three outcome system are shaded. In this figure, $p_3$ is implicit upon specification of $p_1$ and $p_2$.

            <p>
            In the context of shuffling a deck of cards, $S$ was used to assess the probability mass function of the location of a card within the deck after $x$ shuffles.
            Say, for instance, we know a certain card is on the bottom of the deck. When we shuffle the deck once, we can usually make a decent guess as to where the card is in the new arrangment of cards. That is, the probability that the card is in one location, say in the bottom 10-20 cards is greater than it suddenly having jumped to the top of the deck. 
            This non-uniform probability mass function is precisely what is captured by $S$. 
            </p>
            <p>
            As we continue to shuffle, we intuitively "lose track" of where a particular card went, and would be equally likely to find it at any location within the deck.
